# @typhonjs-typedoc/typedoc-theme-dmt
Provides a modern and customizable UX augmentation to the default TypeDoc theme. This theme is perfect for small to 
very large documentation efforts and approaches a ~90% reduction in disk space utilized and 80% speed up in generation. 

I will be updating the README soon with detailed information. The `0.0.0` release is for final live testing.
